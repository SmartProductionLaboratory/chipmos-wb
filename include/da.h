 * in D/A station in 24 hours or not.
 *
 * @var fcst : the amount of die expect to be processed in D/A station in 24
 * hours
 * @var act : the actual amount of die which is processed in D/A station.
 * @var remain : the remain amount of die which is going to be processed.
 * @var upm : unit per minute. How many die are processed in a minute.
 * @var finished : does da_station_t finish arranging the production capacity.
 * @var arrived : store the lot which is waiting in D/A station
 * @var unarrived : store the lot which is unarrived to D/A station.
 * @var remaining : store the lot which will not be processed in D/A in 24
 * hours.
